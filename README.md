About my damn touch triggerz since people are being rude about it

I do not always mind passing ponies, And I do not always mind crowded spaces. 

It is the Idea of touch, it is the idea of someone else touching me. Call me "Chronically Online", I don't care. I don't like it and thats okay. Honestly figure out how to respect boundaries.

Typically, I do not feel deep touch triggers like my touch repulsion unless someone enables it into happening it by repeatedly disrespecting my boundaries, typically i am only a Touch discomfort. 

I am not always a touch trigger. occasionally, I may be a C + H or a Touch Comfort. 

Honestly, why do half of you insult me for having a scary "Touch Trigger" in my name, but when its "Touch comfort", suddenly its okay and not 'just pixels'? Pick a side.
